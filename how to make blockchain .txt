1-> make a class block and constructor to intialise all things
2-> make genesis block
3-> create mine block funcion
4-> generate hash using crypto hash
5-> create blockchain-> create chain a array of block objects and assign first block in chain array as genesis block
6->create add block function in blockchain class
7->create validate blockchain function in blockchain calss
8->create replace chain in blockchain class
9-> add nonce and difficulty to blockchain
10-> update all functions, add nonce and difficulty to hash generator
11-> increase nonce value to generate different hash till you hit target
12-> calculate mining rate , i.e avg itme to make a block in blockchain.
13-> increase difficulty for miners by converting hash from hex to binary 
14-> limiting difficulty for miners
15-> adding node and express to get and post data into Blockchain (establishing connection with one node)
16-> establishing connection with multiple nodes in blockchain
17-> distribute the blockchain to other nodes usign publish subscribe model
        publisher-> cheez publish karte hai
        subscriber-> grap published cheeze if they have subscribed to that channel for the publisher
        there are many channels to publish for the publisher
        miner create block,they put that info on the channel, for that we create channel called blockchain channel
        if subsceiber has subscribed to that channel they will see the added block.
        we use redis to publish 

        a block is created and its info is passed to everyone that a new block is created so add it to their blockchain
        for this communication we use the help of redis.

        create a publisher and scubscriber in express file and channel array which contains blockchain channel
        make the subsccriber subscribe to that channel to establish communication so subscriber gets notified whenever he recives a mesage
        create instance/object of the pubsub model in blockchain file
        assign different port numbers to different nodes as all the blockchain cannot be on the same server as all the system will not run on the same server
        sync all the peers with the blockchain if the new block is added to the chain.
18-> Smitherium ready, Kharid lena pls
