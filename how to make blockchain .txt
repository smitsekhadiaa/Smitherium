1-> make a class block and constructor to intialise all things
2-> make genesis block
3-> create mine block funcion
4-> generate hash using crypto hash
5-> create blockchain-> create chain a array of block objects and assign first block in chain array as genesis block
6->create add block function in blockchain class
7->create validate blockchain function in blockchain calss
8->create replace chain in blockchain class
9-> add nonce and difficulty to blockchain
10-> update all functions, add nonce and difficulty to hash generator
11-> increase nonce value to generate different hash till you hit target
12-> calculate mining rate , i.e avg itme to make a block in blockchain.
13-> increase difficulty for miners by converting hash from hex to binary 
14-> limiting difficulty for miners
